        content_1_c:  'Great opportunity to make a global revision of things, furniture, and appliances. Critically assess the acquired and think about what is needed and what is not. The golden rule is if you havenâ€™t used a thing in over a year, you probably wonâ€™t need it at all. If things are in good condition, but there is no place for them in your new life, they can be exchanged, given for utilization and charity, or even sold by arranging a Â«garage saleÂ» or placing ads on specialized sites for a small price. Also, some stores can take back the furniture and equipment and refund the money. As a last resort - throw it away. Otherwise, youâ€™re overpaying to move garbage.'

Fragile things can be protected with a standard or a bubble wrap, clothes can be transported in special compartments. Order cardboard boxes and sheets online or arrange with furniture and grocery stores. You will also need rope, duct tape, signature markers, garbage bags, a knife, and scissors. Packing things should not be postponed for the last few days. Eat elephant in pieces - start with stuff that will not be needed Â«here and nowÂ»: small appliances, books, Christmas toys. If you move in the summer - start with packing winter clothes and shoes, in the cold season - the opposite. So most of the things will be packed in a couple of days before moving out. Sign boxes on all sides and mark with stickers - Â«Textile. BedroomÂ», Â«Clothes. Childrenâ€™s RoomÂ» - this can help the movers and it will be easier for you to sort things out. Put the parts of the furniture together with the fastening hardware in separate boxes, and put the assembly instructions there.'

Check the operation of the freight elevators, meet the concierge, and walk around the area - in case you urgently need a hardware store or pharmacy.
