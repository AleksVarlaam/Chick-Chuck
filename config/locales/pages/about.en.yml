            desc:             "Hello, my name is Alexander. I am the founder and creator of the service Chick-Chuck.com. With the move to Israel, on the personal experience and experience of people around me, I faced the challenge of constantly moving within the country. I noticed how many carriers in Israel and how much it is in demand. Then I realized that it would be convenient to take and combine all carriers on one site to facilitate the search for a carrier, based on the criteria required by the client, and most importantly the real ratings and reviews from customers, to not run into an unscrupulous carrier and be happy with your move. Those who do not have their own housing and have to constantly move from one rental apartment to another, understand what I mean. Below Iâ€™ll tell you a little about my service."

            desc_html:        "No one underestimates the hard physical work of the loaders and the cost of fuel when transporting your belongings, so the service allows the carrier to indicate the cost of the overhaul distance and transportation of certain items of different categories for each overhauled floor down and up. <br> Moving is not easy and very expensive, the price calculator allows the client to know the preliminary cost of moving among the companies registered in our service. It is impossible to calculate all the nuances at the move without personal participation, so the preliminary cost is approximate, the exact cost of the move is agreed directly with the carrier."
