The golden rule is, you haven’t used a thing in over a year, you probably won’t need it at all. If things are in good condition, but there is no place for them in your new life, they can be exchanged, given for processing and charity or even sold by arranging a «garage sale» or placing ads on special sites for a small price. Also, many stores take back the furniture and equipment they have bought and pay for it. In the extreme case - throw it away. Otherwise, you’re overpaying to move garbage.'

The cost will depend on the time spent on the work and the amount of labor you need. It’s always better to choose a proven company. Read reviews, and do not forget to leave your own review about the services of the carrier, because it helps other people find a conscientious and professional carrier, as helped you once. Inform the carrier in advance of all the details: date, time, distance between areas, floor, the presence of a freight elevator and size of things - you will immediately know the exact cost of services and you can avoid unpleasant surprises. Make a contract and carefully read the conditions of work of the company - what responsibility for things, failure of deadlines, damage to the house property it takes.'

Попрощайтесь с соседями и по возможности оставьте свои контакты на случай, если кто-то будет искать вас по старому адресу.'

It is better if something is not useful, than in the last minutes to look for alternatives or risk the preservation of things. Fragile things will protect ordinary and puffy film, clothes can be transported in special compartments. Order cardboard boxes and sheets online or arrange with furniture and grocery stores. You will also need rope, duct tape, signature markers, garbage bags, a knife and scissors. Packing things should not be postponed for the last days. Eat elephant in pieces - start with things that will not be needed «here and now»: small appliances, books, Christmas toys.Move in the summer - start with packing winter clothes and shoes, in the cold season - the opposite. So a couple of days before moving will be packed most of the things. Boxes sign on all sides and mark stickers - Textile. Bedroom», «Clothes. Children’s Room» - this can help the movers and you will be easier to sort things out. Put the parts of the dismantled furniture together with the fastening hardware in separate boxes, put the assembly instructions there.'

Protect door slopes from damage with cardboard, it is better to cover the floors with protective film. Also check all communications in advance: sockets work, light turns on, water pours. Check the operation of the freight elevators, meet the concierge, walk around the area - in case you urgently need a hardware store or pharmacy.
